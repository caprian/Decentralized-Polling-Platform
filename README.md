# Decentralized Polling Platform

## Overview

The Decentralized Polling Platform is a blockchain-based polling system that utilizes the Polygon blockchain to securely store votes. Users log in by connecting their MetaMask wallet, and only specified wallet addresses are eligible to vote in particular polls. Users can view ongoing polls, vote, create new polls, and set poll durations. Results are displayed after the poll ends.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users log in with their MetaMask wallet.
- **Eligibility Verification**: Voters must hold a specific NFT in their MetaMask wallet to be eligible to vote.
- **Poll Creation**: Users can create polls and set time limits.
- **Real-time Results**: Results are displayed immediately after the poll ends.
